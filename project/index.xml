      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed and deployed Insta KYC solution in France, Romania &amp;amp; Serbia. Brought in a savings of 100 FTE &amp;amp; reduced the remediation time from 20 minutes per client (manual) to 40 seconds (automated) by automating the KYC remediation process using Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/ldv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed and Developed Events driven pipeline for Document Classification, Signature Detection &amp;amp; Verification with State of the art Named Entity Recognition. All documents (Payslips, Self-Certifications , ID cards) were scanned and extracted data were feed into a CRM. for sub-Saharan Africa. This solution was developed for sub-Saharan Africa where financial inclusion is still very limited. The solution reduced the previous verification time from 2 weeks per client (manual) to around 30 minuted by automating
the entire process using Machine Learning. Due to lack of proper network infrastructure in most of sub-Saharan Africa, we deployed machine learning models to run on edge devices for document recognition and extraction of relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/securitynode/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IoT based general purpose Security and Surveillance system for home, office, traffic etc. The application continuously records videos and if there is any motion a signal is sent to the Node Mcu which in turn triggers a buzzer. There is an extended application of integrating with the Dropbox API so that the system can automatically upload security photos to our personal Dropbox account.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed and Developed Events driven pipeline for Document Classification, Signature Detection &amp;amp; Verification with State of the art Named Entity Recognition. All documents (Payslips, Self-Certifications , ID cards) were scanned and were french. We trained all models from scratch using French Embedding. For Document Recognition we used Inception-v3 for transfer learning and fine tuning. RetinaNET for signature detection and Flair NLP framework for NER.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SMART GRID</title>

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/smart-grid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to conserve electricity using IoT-based Smart Grid incorporating different sensors at the power station and houses. Manually determining the root cause of failures is often tedious for a complex system operating in large-scale distributed heterogeneous environments. The model is used to maximize the utility of the consumer, subject to a minimum daily energy consumption level, maximum and minimum hourly load levels, and ramping limits on such load levels. Monitoring the real-time data of the power consumption by the appliances connected to a network and if less than a certain value the re-routing of power to some other place which is in need takes place. A smart meter which delivers the real-time data consumption by the consumers. Fault in one grid leads to the re-routing of power through the nearest grid. A simple bidirectional communication between the power supplier and the consumer enables the implementation of the proposed model.&lt;/p&gt;
