      <description>&lt;p&gt;InstaKYC is an awarding winning deep learning based platform designed to transform &amp;amp; automate KYC processes and needs for both clients and banks. It covers all key stages of KYC; from onboarding, performing KYC remediation to reviews within seconds. The platform is deployed in France, Romania &amp;amp; Serbia. Brought in a savings of 100 FTE &amp;amp; reduced the remediation time from 20 minutes per client (manual) to 40 seconds (automated) by automating the entire process using Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/ldv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed and Developed Events driven pipeline for Document Classification, Signature Detection &amp;amp; Verification with State of the art Named Entity Recognition. All documents (Payslips, Self-Certifications, ID cards) were scanned and extracted data were feed into a CRM. for sub-Saharan Africa. This solution was developed for sub-Saharan Africa where financial inclusion is still very limited. The solution reduced the previous verification time from 2 weeks per client (manual) to around 30 minutes by automating the entire process using Machine Learning. Due to lack of proper network infrastructure in most of sub-Saharan Africa, we deployed machine learning models to run on edge devices for document recognition and extraction of relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/securitynode/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IoT based general purpose Security and Surveillance system for home, office, traffic etc. The application continuously records videos and if there is any motion a signal is sent to the Node Mcu which in turn triggers a buzzer. There is an extended application of integrating with the Dropbox API so that the system can automatically upload security photos to our personal Dropbox account.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/semse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Semse is a search tool that extracts business knowledge trapped inside thousands of documents by mitigating users&amp;rsquo; struggle of finding information that they are looking for. Semse uses all documents in as-is, where-is basis. It automatically learns entire knowledge from all the documents using state of the art deep learning techniques. It is a language-independent search engine that lets users ask questions in any language. It reduces the manual efforts of preparing training data and organizing questions from users. It also uses iterative learning and continuously evolves based on usage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/smart-grid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to conserve electricity using IoT-based Smart Grid incorporating different sensors at the power station and houses. Manually determining the root cause of failures is often tedious for a complex system operating in large-scale distributed heterogeneous environments. The model is used to maximize the utility of the consumer, subject to a minimum daily energy consumption level, maximum and minimum hourly load levels, and ramping limits on such load levels. Monitoring the real-time data of the power consumption by the appliances connected to a network and if less than a certain value the re-routing of power to some other place which is in need takes place. A smart meter which delivers the real-time data consumption by the consumers. Fault in one grid leads to the re-routing of power through the nearest grid. A simple bidirectional communication between the power supplier and the consumer enables the implementation of the proposed model.&lt;/p&gt;
