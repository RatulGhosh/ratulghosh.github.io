      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed and deployed Insta KYC solution in France, Romania &amp;amp; Serbia. Brought in a savings of 100 FTE &amp;amp; reduced the remediation time from 20 minutes per client (manual) to 40 seconds (automated) by automating the KYC remediation process using Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ratulghosh.github.io/project/ldv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed and Developed Events driven pipeline for Document Classification, Signature Detection &amp;amp; Verification with State of the art Named Entity Recognition. All documents (Payslips, Self-Certifications , ID cards) were scanned and extracted data were feed into a CRM. for sub-Saharan Africa. This solution was developed for sub-Saharan Africa where financial inclusion is still very limited. The solution reduced the previous verification time from 2 weeks per client (manual) to around 30 minuted by automating
the entire process using Machine Learning. Due to lack of proper network infrastructure in most of sub-Saharan Africa, we deployed machine learning models to run on edge devices for document recognition and extraction of relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed and Developed Events driven pipeline for Document Classification, Signature Detection &amp;amp; Verification with State of the art Named Entity Recognition. All documents (Payslips, Self-Certifications , ID cards) were scanned and were french. We trained all models from scratch using French Embedding. For Document Recognition we used Inception-v3 for transfer learning and fine tuning. RetinaNET for signature detection and Flair NLP framework for NER.&lt;/p&gt;
